## Building the application

This application is created using [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/) v4.4.1. Take note you must use .NET edition of the engine, the regular edition doesn't support building with C# code. Information about using Godot with C# can be found [in the documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/c_sharp/index.html). C# support in the built-in code editor is limited, look [at this page](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/c_sharp/c_sharp_basics.html#configuring-an-external-editor) to configure Godot to use external editor for code.

## Navigating the source code

* `GameData` directory contains a submodule pointing to repository with BitCraft game data in JSON format, as well as scripts that are used to convert that data into different JSON files used by BitPlanner. `generate_data.sh` runs all scripts and writes version of the data. This is only necessary to run after updating the game data or changing the scripts, the content of `GameData` is not included into the application.
* `BitPlanner` directory contains sources for the application itself, it's a Godot game engine project:
  * `Assets` directory contains non-code resources (mostly icons extracted from the official game client and downscaled);
  * `Helpers` directory is for classes that are used for getting various data without creating a specific model or attaching to a Godot scene node;
  * `Models` contains models classes to work with the game data and application settings;
  * `Scenes` contains Godot engine scene files and scripts attached to root nodes of scenes with matching name.

## Creating a SQLite database from the game data

Run `create_crafting_db.py` to convert `crafting_data.json` into a SQLite database.

The script creates `crafting_data.db` by default and stores item information and all recipe details for offline use.
